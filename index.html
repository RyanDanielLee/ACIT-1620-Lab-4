        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is <strong><i>Ryan Lee</i></strong> and I am
          <strong><i>very excited</i></strong> to learn all about web
          programming. I have prior computer science studies, and hope to
          advance my knowledge in CIT! I was born in Vancouver and have lived
          here all my life. I like to <em>snowboard</em> during the winter, play
          <em>video games</em> and love listening to <em>music!</em>
        </p>
